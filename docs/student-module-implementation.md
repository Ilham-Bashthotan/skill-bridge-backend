# Student Module Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete student module following the API specification with DTOs, controller, service, and validation.

## Files Created/Updated

### DTOs
- `src/student/dto/update-student-profile.dto.ts` - Profile update validation

### Service
- `src/student/student.service.ts` - Complete business logic implementation
  - Dashboard statistics
  - Profile management
  - Course browsing and enrollment
  - Material progress tracking
  - Certificate management

### Controller

  - GET /students/courses/enrolled
  - POST /students/courses/:courseId/enroll
  - GET /students/courses/:courseId
  - GET /students/courses/:courseId/materials
  - PUT /students/courses/:courseId/materials/:materialId/progress
  - GET /students/certificates

### Validation
- `src/student/student.validation.ts` - Zod schemas for runtime validation
